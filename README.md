# Marketing_Sales_Prediction

The aim is to build a model which predicts sales based on the money spent on different platforms such as TV, radio, and newspaper for marketing.

In this project I apply simple linear regression and multiple linear regeression machine learning algorithm for predict marketing sales for TV, Radio and Newspaper

## Steps :
1) Loading the dataset
2) Data Pre-Processing :
   1. Checking for missing values
   2. Checking for duplicate rows
   3. Checking for outliers  
3) Exploratory Data Analysis :
   1. Distribution of the target variable
   2. How Sales are related with other variables
   3. Feature selection
4) Model Building:

   Linear Regression is a useful tool for predicting a quantitative response.
   Prediction using: 1. Simple Linear Regression 2. Multiple Linear Regression

   1. Simple Linear Regression

   Simple linear regression has only one x and one y variable. It is an approach for predicting    a quantitative response using a single feature.

   It establishes the relationship between two variables using a straight line. Linear      regression attempts to draw a line that comes closest to the data by finding the slope and   intercept that define the line and minimize regression errors.

   Formula: Y = β0 + β1X + e

   Y = Dependent variable / Target variable
   
   β0 = Intercept of the regression line 
   
   β1 = Slope of the regression lime which tells whether the line is increasing or decreasing
   
   X = Independent variable / Predictor variable
   
   e = Error
   
   Equation: Sales = β0 + β1X + TV
